# **Memory Garden**

## **Overview**

**Memory Garden** is an interactive 3D experience exploring the relationship between nature, memory, and abandoned technology. The project builds a dreamcore-inspired environment—quiet, surreal, and suspended outside of linear time—where digital artifacts coexist with organic overgrowth.

Rendered through **Three.js** and **3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)**, the scene invites visitors to walk through the space, uncover narrative fragments, and engage with subtle interactive moments.
The central question guiding the work is:
**What remains of the worlds we create when their makers disappear?**

## **Inspiration**

The project began with dreamcore imagery: empty, peaceful spaces that feel strangely familiar yet detached from time. I wanted to create a personal world that carries this softness—gentle, calm, and lightly haunted by the passing of time.

A recurring thought shaped the concept. We build complex technologies, simulations, and worlds, but what happens to them after us? This idea solidified into the visual centerpiece of the garden: a broken computer resting in a forest, slowly reclaimed by nature. Here, technology persists only as memory, not function.

*Memory Garden* emerged from that tension.

## **Process**

### **1. Concept Development**

Defined the thematic direction around memory, dreamcore aesthetics, and the coexistence of digital remnants with natural growth.

### **2. Image Exploration**

Generated and refined dozens of scene concepts using Midjourney and ChatGPT, iterating on composition, color, and emotional tone.

### **3. 3DGS Scene Creation**

Used Marble to convert selected images into **3D Gaussian Splatting** scenes, enabling volumetric rendering without full 3D modeling.

### **4. Rendering Integration**

Started with GaussianSplats3D, but due to model-loading issues, transitioned to **Spark**, whose active development and Three.js compatibility allowed the scene to render reliably in the browser.

### **5. Narrative & Interaction Design**

Added environmental storytelling elements: interactive memory nodes, an animated butterfly and cat, ambient audio layers, and floating orbs that reveal fragments of the world.

## **Experience**

Memory Garden is designed for slow, nonlinear exploration.
Visitors can move through the forest, approach memory points, and observe subtle details embedded within the environment.
The broken computer, scattered keys, dim roses, shifting sounds, and small creatures form a quiet ecosystem of memories.

Rather than guiding the viewer toward a goal, the space encourages presence—an environment to be felt rather than solved.
